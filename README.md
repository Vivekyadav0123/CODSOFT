 My CodSoft AI Internship Projects

This repository includes the Python-based tasks I've completed during my *CodSoft AI Internship*.

Task 1 ‚Äì Smart Chatbot

This is a command-line chatbot created using Python.  
It can understand and reply to common user inputs like:

- Saying "hi" or "hello"
- Asking the bot's name
- Showing the current time, date, or day
- Sharing motivational quotes
- Telling the meaning of words like ‚ÄúAI‚Äù or ‚ÄúPython‚Äù
- Solving basic math like 7 + 4 or 5 * 3

 *File*: [smart chatbot.py](smartchatbot.py )

 How to Run:
python chatbot.py


The bot runs in the terminal and responds until you type exit or bye.



 Task 2 ‚Äì Tic Tac Toe AI

A simple terminal-based Tic Tac Toe game where you play as *X, and the AI plays as **O*.  
The AI is powered by the *Minimax algorithm*, which makes the smartest possible move.

Features:

- 3x3 grid, using keys 1‚Äì9 to mark positions
- Detects win, draw, or lose conditions
- Simple and user-friendly interface
- AI never lets you win easily üòÑ

 *File*: [Tictactoe_ai.py](Tictactoe_ai.py)

 How to Run:

python Tictactoe_ai.py


 Task 3 ‚Äì Product Recommendation System

This project suggests similar products based on their text descriptions.  
It compares the product you enter with other products and finds the closest matches.

Main Points:

- Reads product list from a .csv file
- Uses basic word-matching 
- Shows most similar products with matching score

 *Files*:
- [recommendation.py](recommendation.py)
- [products.csv](products.csv)

 How to Run:

python recommendation.py

- Make sure products.csv is placed in the same folder as the Python file.
